PROJECT:

React San Diego Top Spots

DESCRIPTION:

This project is a Reactjs experiment in pulling JSON data into object array to populate a table for public reading. The last column holds a link that opens to the top spot's location on Google Maps using given coordinates from the JSON data.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Start program from terminal and view at localhost.
2. Learn about some of San Diego's trendy, over-hyped top spots (though some of this information is out of date).
3. Click the Google link to find the spot's location!
4. Have fun, you tourist!
